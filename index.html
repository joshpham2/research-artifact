  <h2>Early Identification of Dominant Instability Patterns in a Complex Engineered System</h2>

  <p><em>Working draft. Exploratory study.</em></p>

  <p>
    This study examines whether early structural change in high-dimensional engineered systems
    can be detected using reduced-order representations rather than threshold-based metrics.
    The current example is manufacturing-based, but the formulation is intended to be domain-agnostic and diagnostic.
